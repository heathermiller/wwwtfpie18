**Welcome!** The 2018 edition
of Trends in Functional Programming in Education will be held at Chalmers
University in Gothenburg, Sweden, following the TFP meeting (exact dates TBA).

The goal of TFPIE is to gather researchers, teachers and professionals that use,
or are interested in the use of, functional programming in education. TFPIE aims
to be a venue where novel ideas, classroom-tested ideas and work-in-progress on
the use of functional programming in education are discussed. The one-day
workshop will foster a spirit of open discussion by having a review process for
publication after the workshop. The program chair of TFPIE 2016 will screen
submissions to ensure that all presentations are within scope and are of
interest to participants. After the workshop, presenters will be invited to
submit revised versions of their articles for publication in the journal
Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS).

TFPIE workshops have previously been held in St Andrews, Scotland (2012), Provo
Utah, USA (2013), Soesterberg, The Netherlands (2014), Sophia-Antipolis, France
(2015), College Park, USA (2016), and Canterbury, UK (2017).
